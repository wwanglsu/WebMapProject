Web-based GIS Application for LA Historical Crime Data Queries

In this project, I developed the application by JSP, JavaScript framework (Dojo), T-SQL in Microsoft SQL Server 
and ArcGIS products.

The functions involve:
1. Louisiana historical parish crime data attribute queries by dynamically render map of color ramp; 
2. Text-input buffer query ;
3. Map eagle view window, measure any geographic objectâ€™s length and area ;
4. Address locates and Address query ;
5. The project also achieves the function of user sign-in/sign-up and email activation features and video tutorials, 
6. Manager role can enjoy more web map services, like base map switch and instant view of any geographic data 
   (Shapefile) and query attribute table.
